============== SUBQUERIES ==============

A subquery is a query that is nested inside another query, or inside another subquery. 
(Like a Python nested function / variable)
Subquery will run before main query.
Subquery normally dont have have relation with main query.

++ SINGLE VALUE
The simplest subquery returns exactly one column and exactly one row. 
It can be used with comparison operators =, <, <=, >, or >=.
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE rating = (
  SELECT rating
  FROM city
  WHERE name = 'Paris'
);

++ MULTIPLE VALUES
A subquery can also return multiple columns or multiple rows. 
Such subqueries can be used with operators IN, EXISTS, ALL, or ANY.
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE country_id IN (
  SELECT country_id
  FROM country
  WHERE population > 20000000
);

============== Indexes ==============
SQL Indexes are special lookup tables that are used to speed up the process of data retrieval.
They hold pointers that refer to the data stored in a database, 
which makes it easier to locate the required data records in a database table.

++Unique Indexes
Unique indexes are used not only for performance, but also for data integrity.
A unique index does not allow any duplicate values to be inserted into the table.

============== SQL AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS ==============

avg(expr) − average value for rows within the group
count(expr) − count of values for rows within the group
max(expr) − maximum value within the group
min(expr) − minimum value within the group
sum(expr) − sum of values within the group

============== GROUP BY ==============
The GROUP BY clause is typically used with aggregate functions.
The main purpose of grouping the records of a table based on particular columns is to PERFORM CALCULATIONS on these groups. 

++GROUP BY Clause on Single Columns
When we use the GROUP BY clause with a single column, 
all the rows in the table that HAVE THE SAME VALUE in that particular column will be merged into a single record.

++GROUP BY Clause with Multiple Columns
When we use the GROUP BY clause with multiple columns, 
all the rows in the table that HAVE THE SAME VALUES in all of the specified columns will be merged into a single group.

++GROUP BY with HAVING Clause
To FILTER THE GROUPED DATA in a table based on specific criteria.
